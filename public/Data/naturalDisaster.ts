      "People in flood-prone areas suffer in various ways when floods occur. Homes and belongings are often destroyed, leaving individuals and families displaced and without basic necessities. Access to clean water and food becomes limited, leading to health risks such as waterborne diseases and malnutrition. Livelihoods are disrupted as crops are damaged, livestock lost, and businesses destroyed. Displacement can lead to emotional distress and trauma, especially for vulnerable populations. Additionally, the lack of proper infrastructure and resources in poor communities exacerbates the suffering, making it difficult for people to recover and rebuild their lives after the floods recede.",

    details:
      "During droughts, people suffer from water scarcity, leading to difficulties accessing clean water for drinking, sanitation, and agriculture. This scarcity often results in food shortages as crops fail, leading to malnutrition and economic hardship for farmers. Livelihoods are further threatened as pastoralists struggle to feed and maintain their livestock. The economic impact is profound, with declines in agricultural productivity contributing to poverty and income loss. Environmental degradation, such as soil erosion and desertification, exacerbates the situation, affecting ecosystems and biodiversity. Social tensions may arise due to increased competition for dwindling resources, potentially leading to conflicts over water and land. Vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and those with health conditions, bear the brunt of these challenges. Ultimately, droughts pose long-term challenges to economic and environmental sustainability.",

      "People suffer greatly from cyclones due to their powerful and destructive nature. Cyclones bring strong winds and heavy rainfall, leading to extensive property damage, flooding, and loss of life. Homes, buildings, and infrastructure are devastated, leaving people without shelter and basic services. Many are forced to evacuate their homes, leading to displacement and overcrowding in shelters. The risk of waterborne diseases increases due to contaminated water sources, and limited access to medical care exacerbates health issues. The emotional toll is significant, with the loss of loved ones and possessions causing anxiety and trauma. Essential services such as electricity, water supply, and transportation are disrupted, hindering rescue and relief efforts. The economic impact is substantial, with businesses closing and job losses occurring. Overall, cyclones bring widespread suffering, requiring extensive recovery efforts to rebuild communities and livelihoods.",
